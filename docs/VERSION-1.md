## Slide-by-Slide Breakdown

### SLIDE 1: Hook (10 seconds)

**Visual:** Single stat, big text, dark background

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│     "Why did users leave?"                  │
│                                             │
│         ¯\_(ツ)_/¯                          │
│                                             │
│     — Every product team, every week        │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Say:**
> "Every week, product teams ask 'why did users drop off?' And every week, they're guessing."

### SLIDE 2: Problem (20 seconds)

**Visual:** Three pain points with icons

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│  The UX Blindspot Problem                   │
│                                             │
│  😤 Users don't tell you what's broken      │
│     — they just leave                       │
│                                             │
│  📊 Analytics show WHAT happened            │
│     — not WHY or WHAT TO DO                 │
│                                             │
│  💸 Real UX research is slow & expensive    │
│     — $10K+ per study, weeks to complete    │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Say:**
> "Users don't file bug reports for bad UX — they just leave. Analytics tell you what happened, but not why or what to fix. And real UX research? Thousands of dollars, weeks of waiting."

│   Behavioral events → AI analysis →         │
│   Prioritized UI fixes with evidence        │
│                                             │
│   Like having a UX researcher watching      │
│   every session and telling you what to fix │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Say:**
> "We built Friction — the AI UX researcher. It watches behavioral events, detects friction patterns, and gives product teams specific, prioritized UI fixes with the evidence to back them up."

**Say:**
> "Here's how it works: we capture behavioral events, AI detects friction patterns, and outputs prioritized fixes. Let me show you."

### DEMO (90 seconds)

This is where you win or lose. Show THREE clear moments:

---

#### Demo Moment 1: Events Flowing In (20 seconds)

**Show:** Live event stream or simulation

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LIVE EVENTS                                │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  ● element_clicked: "brush_tool" (0.3s)     │
│  ● element_clicked: "canvas" (1.2s)         │
│  ● feature_search: "export" (2.1s)          │
│  ● element_clicked: "file_menu" (3.4s)      │
│  ● element_clicked: "export_submenu" (4.8s) │
│  ● rage_click_detected: "export_btn" ⚠️     │
│  ● element_clicked: "export_confirm" (6.2s) │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Say:**
> "Here's a user session. Watch the events flow in — clicks, searches, navigation. Notice they searched for 'export', then we see a rage click. They're frustrated."

#### Demo Moment 2: AI Analysis Dashboard (40 seconds)

**Show:** Main dashboard with friction insights

```

**Say:**
> "The AI processes all sessions and surfaces this. Our top friction point: Export. 73% of users are searching for it, it takes 4 clicks to reach, and we detected 12 rage clicks this week. The AI recommends: 'Surface export in the toolbar' — with predicted impact of 40% friction reduction. Below that, we see workflow issues and unused features eating up UI space."

```

**Say:**
> "Click in and you get the evidence: 847 searches, average 6 seconds to find a feature that should take 1, plus user journey showing exactly where they got stuck. The AI gives you the fix AND the reasoning. Accept it, dismiss it, or tweak it — the system learns from your decision."

**Say:**
> "Why does this win? Real impact — product teams would ship this today. It saves weeks of UX research and reduces churn by catching friction early. And it's a perfect Amplitude fit: real behavioral events, AI doing what rules can't, and a clear data-to-action loop that improves over time."

## Demo Checklist

What you need to build for this to land:

| Must Have | Nice to Have |
|-----------|--------------|
| ✅ Live event stream visualization | Animated event flow |
| ✅ Dashboard with 3 prioritized insights | More insight types |
| ✅ Drill-down view with evidence | User journey visualization |
| ✅ AI recommendation with reasoning | Before/after mockup |
| ✅ Accept/reject buttons | Feedback learning demo |

---

## Presentation Tips

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Rehearse to exactly 3 minutes | Wing it |
| Pause after the hook | Rush through problem |
| Make eye contact during demo | Read from screen |
| Say "Let me show you" before demo | Explain what you're about to show |
| End with confident silence | Trail off at the end |

---

## Quick Rehearsal Script (Full)

> "Every week, product teams ask 'why did users drop off?' And every week, they're guessing.
>
> The truth is: users don't tell you what's broken — they just leave. Analytics show what happened, not why. And real UX research costs thousands and takes weeks.
>
> We built Friction — the AI UX researcher. It watches behavioral events, detects friction patterns, and gives product teams specific, prioritized fixes with evidence.
>
> Let me show you.
>
> [DEMO: Events flowing]
> Here's a user session. Watch the events — clicks, searches. Notice they searched for 'export', then rage clicked. They're frustrated.
>
> [DEMO: Dashboard]
> The AI surfaces this: Export is our top friction point. 73% of users search for it, 4 clicks to reach, 12 rage clicks this week. Recommendation: surface it in the toolbar. Predicted impact: 40% less friction.
>
> [DEMO: Drill-down]
> Click in: here's the evidence. 847 searches, 6 seconds to find, the exact user journey showing where they got stuck. Accept the fix, dismiss it, or tweak it — the AI learns from your choice.
>
> And that's the key: it's self-improving. Every decision makes it smarter.
>
> Why does this win? Product teams would use this today. It saves weeks of research, reduces churn, and is perfectly aligned with Amplitude's vision: behavioral events, AI insight, action loop.
>
> Friction — the AI UX researcher. From rage clicks to roadmap. Thank you."

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize the name** — Friction? Or another option?
2. **Build the event simulator** — Fake but realistic event stream
3. **Build the dashboard UI** — Static or semi-functional is fine
4. **Write 3 hardcoded insights** — Make them compelling
5. **Rehearse 5x** — Timing is everything
